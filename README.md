# GetAtMe
This app says "I'm ready when you are" in the easiest way possible.
I just got tired of sending a message to my development pair via chat every morning or after lunch.
Too much back and forth.
I just needed a button that would indicate I was ready whenever.
I also just wanted to learn Elixir!

## Configuration
There's some required ENV variables.
- GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
- GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

Then start like a normal Phoenix app
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
